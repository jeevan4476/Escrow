# Anchor Escrow 

## Using Solana Kit, Kite, and Codama ðŸš€

## Introduction

This Solana program implements an **escrow**, enabling secure token swaps between users. For example, Alice can offer 10 USDC in exchange for 100 WIF.

Without an escrow, users face significant risks:

- **Traditional finance** charges 1-6% in fees, eating into your funds.
- **Manual swaps** are prone to fraud. If Bob takes Alice's 10 USDC but doesn't send the 100 WIF, or if Alice fails to deliver after receiving Bob's tokens, someone gets burned.

The **Anchor Escrow** program acts as a trusted intermediary, releasing tokens only when both parties meet the agreed terms. This ensures Alice and Bob each receive 100% of their desired tokens, securely and without middleman fees.
